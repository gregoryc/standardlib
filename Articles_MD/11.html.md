The Solution of Foundationallib
===============================

\# foundationallib [Online documentation

Finally, a cross-platform, portable, well-designed, secure, robust, maximally-efficient C foundational library --- Making Engineering And Computing Fast, Secure, Responsive And Easy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\

-   **Enables better Engineering Solutions and Security broadly and
    foundationally where Software Creation or Development or Script
    Creation is concerned - whether this be on a local, business,
    governmental or international basis, and makes things easier - and
    Computing in General.** Don\'t Reinvent the Wheel - Use Good
    Wheels - Be Safe And Secure.
-   **Enables a free-flowing dynamic computer usage that you need,
    deserve and should have, simply because you have a computer. With
    full speed and with robustness. You deserve to be able to use your
    computer wholly and fully, with proper and fast operations.**
-   **Enables flexibility and power - makes C accessible to the masses
    (and faster and more secure) with easy usage and strives to bring
    people up, not degrade the character or actions of people.** This is
    a fundamental and unequivocal philosophy difference between this
    library and many subsections of Software Engineering and the
    mainstream engineering establishment. For instance, in Python, you
    cannot read a file easily -- you have to read it line-by-line or
    open a file, read the lines, then close it. With this library, you
    can efficiently read 10,000 files in one function call. This library
    gives power. Any common operation, there ought to be a powerful
    function for.\
    \
    We should not bitch around with assembly when we don\'t want to; we
    should also have full speed. Some old \"solutions\" deliver neither,
    then culturally degrade programmers because their tools are bad -
    actually, it just degrades programmers, and gives them bad tools.
    COBOL is an example \...\
    \
    Human technology is about empowerment -- people must fight for it to
    be empowerment, we don\'t have time to have AI systems kill us
    because we want to have bad tools and be weak. We must fight.

-   →**Cross platform** - works perfectly in embedded, server, desktop,
    and all platforms - tested for Windows and UNIX - 64-bit and 32-bit,
    includes a 3-aspect test suite, with more to come.

-   →**Bug free. Reliable. Dependable. Secure. Tested well.**

-   →**Zero Overhead** - Only 1 byte due to the power of the error
    handling, can be configured will full power.

-   →**Static Inline Functions if you want them** (optional) -
    Eliminating function call overhead to 0 if you wish, for improved
    performance.

-   →**Custom allocators** - if you want it.

-   →**Custom error handling** - if you want it.

-   →**Safe functions** warn the programmer about NULL values and unused
    return values. Can be configured to not compile if not Secure.
    Optional null-check macros in every library function. Does not use
    any of
    `"gets", "fgets", "strcpy", "strcat", "sprintf", "vsprintf", "scanf", "fscanf", "system", "chown", "chmod", "chgrp", "alloca", "execl", "execle", "execlp", "execv", "execve", "execvp", "bcopy", "bzero"`.
    You can configure it to never use any unsafe functions.

-   →**Portable** - works on all platforms, using platform specific
    features (using \#ifdefs) to make functions better and faster.

-   →**Multithreading support** (optional), with
    list\_comprehension\_multithreaded (accepts any number of threads,
    works in parallel using portable C11 threads)

-   →**Networking support** (optional), using libcurl - making it
    extremely easy to download websites and arrays of websites -
    features other languages do not have.

-   →Very good and thorough **Error Handling** and **allocation
    overflow** checking (good for **Security and Robustness**) in the
    functions. Allows the programmer to dynamically choose to catch all
    errors in the functions with a handler (default or custom), or to
    ignore them. No need to ALWAYS say \"if (\.....) if you don\'t want
    to. Can be changed at runtime.

-   →**Public Domain** so you make the code how you want. (No need to
    \"propitiate\" to some \"god\" of some library).

-   →**Minimal abstractions or indirection of any kind or needless slow
    things that complicate things** - macros, namespace collision,
    typedefs, structs, object-orientation messes, slow compilation
    times, bloat, etc., etc.

-   →**No namespace pollution** - you can generate your [**own
    version**]{style="font-style:normal;"} with any prefix you like!

-   →**Relies [minimally]{style="font-style:normal;"} on C libraries -
    it can be fully decoupled from LIB C and can be statically linked.**

-   →[**Very small**]{style="font-style:normal;"} - 13K Lines of Code
    (including Doxygen comments and following of Best Practices)

-   →**No Linkage Issues or dependency hell**

-   →**Thorough and clear documentation**, with examples of usage.

-   →**No licensing restrictions whatsoever - use it for your
    engineering project, your startup, your Fortune 500 company, your
    personal project, your throw-away script, your government.**

-   →**Makes C like Python or Perl or Ruby in many ways - or more easy**

-   →**Easy Straightforward Transpilation Support** - to make current
    code, much faster - all without any bloat (See
    transpile\_slow\_scripting\_into\_c.rb).

-   #### In many cases, there is now a direct mapping of functions from other languages into optimized C. See the example script in this repository. This makes optimizing your Python / Perl / Ruby / PHP etc. script very easy, either manually or through the use of AI.

Foundationallib Features {#foundationallib-features style="color:green;"}
------------------------

**Functional Programming Features** - `map, reduce, filter,` List
Comprehensions in C and much more!

**Expands C\'s Primitives for easy manipulation of data types** such as
Arrays, Strings, `Dict`, `Set`, `FrozenDict`, `FrozenSet` - **and
enables easy manipulation, modification, alteration, comparison,
sorting, counting, IO (printing) and duplication of these at a very
comfortable level** - something very, very rare in C or C++, *all
without any overhead.*

**More comfortable IO** - read and write entire files with ease, and
convert complex types into strings or print them on the screen with
ease.

**A powerful general purpose Foundational Library** - *which has
anything and everything you need* - from `replace_all()` to
`replace_memory()` to `find_last_of()` to to `list_comprehension()` to
`shellescape()` to `read_file_into_string()` to `string_to_json()` to
`string_to_uppercase()` to `to_title_case()` to `read_file_into_array()`
to `read_files_into_array()` to `map()` to `reduce()` to `filter()` to
`list_comprehension_multithreaded()` to `frozen_dict_new_instance()` to
`backticks()` - everything you would want to make quick and optimally
efficient C programs, this has it.

Helps to make programs hundreds of times faster than other languages
with similar ease of creation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Easily take advantage of CPU cores with
list\_comprehension\_multithreaded()**.\
\
You can specify the number of threads, the transform and the filter
functions, and this will transform your data - all in parallel. Don\'t
have a multithreaded environment? Then disable it (set the flag).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### You don\'t want to be reinventing the wheel and hoping that your memory allocation is secure enough - and then failing. **Security Is Paramount.**

### You don\'t want to be waiting [a day]{style="color:rgb(240, 0, 0);"} for an operation to complete when it could take [less than an hour]{style="color:rgb(30, 30, 255);"}.

\

This library is founded on very strong and unequivocal goals and
philosophy. In fact, I have written many articles about the foundation
of this library and more relevantly the broader context. See the
Articles folder - for some of the foundation of this library.

\

This library is an ideal and a dream - not just a Software Library. As
such, I would highly suggest that you support me in this mission. Even
if it\'s different from the status quo. Are you a Rust or Zig fan? Then
make a Rust or Zig version of this ideal. Let\'s go. Give me an email.
