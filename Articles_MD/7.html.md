Narcissism and Arrogance
========================

By G.C.
-------

The world is filled with a great deal of narcissism and arrogance. A lot
of the time people *HORRIBLY* misuse the word "narcissism," as if it had
any weight for anyone and was something other than a symbol of
degradation, domination and human labelling.

Such is certainly present in the mainstream engineering establishment,
even though they don\'t admit it.

It is filled with a bunch of people who act like their the only ones in
the world, and who are asocial.
