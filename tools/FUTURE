Future plans



* In the future, I'm going to follow my philosophy more and implement more functions,
		for example, more string replace functions.

		The current code is rather good.

		One thing I could do is on UNIX, bypass fread() and fwrite() and use direct file
		descriptors, presumably for efficiency, to bypass Glibc.

		The error handling would be similar.



* More collaborators would be great. Please email me.
