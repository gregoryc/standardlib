The Cycle of Ethical Behavior Audio Transcript
By Gregory Cohen


There is a Cycle of Operation. This is the “Cycle of Ethical Behavior”.

1. Fixate.
2. Worsen social relations.
3. Find and take environmental data, research could be done, no “moral” or “ethical” limitations.
4. Fix existential limitations problem for group.
5. Become somewhat “sane” again.
6. Go to 1. Repeat literally ad infinitum.

Now, this is a modus operandi that all human beings and robots should follow.

It is somewhat dangerous but it leads to actual results.

There is a TREMENDOUS amount of potential with this method of operation.

But it is important that it be understood. It could be applied in a top down fashion from above (the billionaires, etc.), but it would be ideal if the common people understood this too – and if this didn't have to be applied by true pure Fascism – but rather agreement.

From this – an Axiology can be found – a philosophy or study of Value – comprised of the two branches of the field of Axiology - Ethics and Aesthetics. I came up with this in 2018.

In terms of Ethics, it works like this -

To be a Good Being, one must be able to be considered to be in the cycle by other(s), by self, and agree with the Cycle of Ethical Behavior.

There are 3 kinds of observers (people, human beings, “men,” etc.)

1. A Good Observer; all others are 2 or 3
2. A Tool Observer, acts as a tool for Good Observer(s) and follows normal mores and “agree”s to most things; all others are 3
3. An Abominable Observer; the “catch-all” for all other observers

"Observer" here is a specific term from a book that I wrote in 2018 about this stuff. It was only a draft.

It is very important – extremely important – that people evaluate ethics for themselves and others in this way.

And that people follow the Cycle of Ethical Behavior.
