<h1>The Problem with the Mainstream Engineering Establishment</h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>

<p>There is a major problem in the modern world &ndash; the mainstream
engineering establishment.</p>

<p>This is a very major problem. In the following sixteen articles, I
shall enumerate some of the major issues with it, and I shall provide
effective principles and remedies by which to dynamically address
the current status quo. Additionally, I will present foundationallib,
which is built with very good computer software code, and it is an
effective tool, but not in line with current values of the current
mainstream establishment.</p>

<p>The largest problem with the mainstream engineering establishment is a profound and thorough lack of
free speech and free discourse in the system. This is widely pervasive and is international.</p>
<p>Without beating around the bush:</p>

<p>The problem of lack of discourse in the engineering
establishment and in its perverse affected subjects (all of
mainstream academia) must be met by violence in order for them to
listen &ndash; inasmuch as they are unequivocally extremely set in their ways, and
they uniformly do not listen to other views&mdash;maybe with a gleam or
a fake uniformly disingenuous smile, but never sincerely. The
solution to this and the only solution to the resolution of this &ndash; is outright violence and murder. They need to be murdered. Along
with speech. That will get them to listen to speech.</p>

<p>Because left to their own devices, they will not. And then the current mess that we are all in,
as enumerated in the following sixteen articles, would continue.</p>

<p>People should adhere to what people smarter than them in a given
domain know in terms of understandings and reasoning abilities, if
such have been hitherto made. This means primarily mathematicians
making a logical statement. It doesn't mean adhering to
climatologists who don't have compelling arguments in terms of why
one should act a certain way or not &ndash; this is political, and their
arguments are ambiguous and not strong, and not basic to people's
modus operandi and how they operate and think.</p>

<p>All action must be based on heuristics of the proper solution to
the Right Problem at hand. Knowing the Right Problem is more
important than any solutions.</p>

<p>The Right Problem is probably not what the individual is being
told &ndash; family, race, gender, economic circumstances, lack of
education or experience or being in the right place at the right
time &ndash; these are all not the Right Problem.</p>

<p>The Right Problem is categorical and isn't based on the
individual.</p>

<p>It depends on philosophical circumstances.</p>

<p>We are talking about human action, human techne, in order to
resolve problems.</p>

<p>A sub-problem is likely to be a lack of power in operation, in
techne.</p>

<p>Therefore, people strive after connection, money, influence,
high status, in order to resolve a given problem, or problems
collectively.</p>

<p>The Right Problem likely relates to survival and knowing as much
as possible.</p>

<p>But in order to not alienate the reader, I need not wax
philosophical about the topmost “right problem.”</p>

<p>In human techne, in operation, there are also "Right Sub
Problems".</p>

<p>A “Right Sub Problem” might be</p>

<p>Now, this Sub Problem 3 of Existence is interesting.</p>

<p>Human operation as of 2023/2024 DOES NOT align with this at all,
no one can argue it does. The machines we use are slow and clunky,
needlessly. This is on the hardware side. On the software side -
the situation is even worse. The world is not logical. It is not
and it should be. Alternatives are: logical world, good world,
illogical world; a semblance of Hell itself.</p>

<p>Logic is good. Logic is easiness is goodness is rightness is
properness.</p>

<p>Illogic is all of the bad and hellish qualities of man.</p>

<p>Illogic is when actions are executed that don't align with a
proper goal.</p>

<p>Making messes without satisfaction of anyone and without any
purpose of the mess, is illogic. It is not good and must be
purged.</p>

<p>We world is full of illogic. Most things are wrong.</p>

<p>We are on the brink of killing all of ourselves.</p>

<p>We don't postulate high goals often.</p>

<p>We don't align our actions with high goals often.</p>

<p>We aren't COGNIZANT of high goals often &ndash; we don't even know of
them.</p>

<p>The engineering establishment is VERY set in its ways. If you
try to denuclearize a country by telling them "be more logical man,
act better", would they humbly introspect and consult the most
educated mathematicians in an area, humbly delegating the high
logic to them (not the physicists or politicians or partisans, to
be quite unequivocal and clear, the mathematicians and perhaps
logicians). Or would they turn to their cliquish nature, reddit,
their social media friends, their hivemind, their hive-mind
peers?</p>

<p>They don't act logically. For the last 200 years there has been
one debacle after another. This is not written as a high brow
letter but as an encouragement of proactive change &ndash; NOW. Violence
is the only solution here &ndash; and I hope people get mad at this. I am
not a troll, don't care about angering others, but angering others
is the only solution. Whether it be someone like Trump or someone
on the other side, we need radicals &ndash; both in low levels and in
leader levels, to change things. Even Trump, early on, wasn't
radical or violent, in many ways he was the opposite. I want to be
quite clear and unequivocal here.</p>

<p>Violence IS the solution.</p>

<p>The engineering establishment is too stuck in its ways &ndash; in
religion, in culture, in non-criminality (a giant limiting trap),
in social status, in wages, in future plans, in past engineering
“accomplishments” (which is just arrogance and only contributes to
the destruction that we're still in), and in current vices.</p>

<p>Barring a bunch of people violating norms and laws, unabashedly,
and fighting to the highest of their ability, is it almost
impossible that there would be an actual solution.</p>

<p>We have become a culture of losers &ndash; and to blame is the
mainstream engineering establishment since the industrial
revolution for not fighting back and revolting against
themselves.</p>

<p>We need MORE criminality, MORE arrests, MORE violence, MORE
speaking out.</p>

<p>There is, unequivocally and without a doubt, too many people who
expect high salaries for the educated without moral checks, moral
checks for what is important.</p>

<p>Let's enumerate here how EVERYTHING in the current scene is
failing.</p>

<p><strong>Income Equality</strong> &ndash; Lack of it.</p>

<p>In recent decades, under the influence of the so-called educated
and mainstream engineering cult, which goes hand in hand with
business and is the bread an butter of business, income inequality
has gone to all hell since they killed the USSR. The finger of
submission is stronger than ever in many ways, children are paying
more and more for college degrees they can't use as a symbol of
submission and degradation to the mainstream engineering
establishment, and living is becoming harder and harder the more
they control. Their products get massed produced on a larger scale,
and there is more and more poverty in the populace, quite
ironically. Since the death of the idealism of the communism
project (which had never been shown to work but at least pretended
to believe in something, they have projected their arrogant, ugly
claws more and more on the average people). And, they are wholly
undemocratic in their viewpoints, they don't tolerate choice,
talking or conversation itself.</p>

<p><strong>Climate</strong> &ndash; We are coming up with a million
dangerous climate circumstances. There is garbage articulation of
the dangers here because the engineers and people in charge of this
act too insular and sanctimonious &ndash; actually, they want the climate
to fail, it is in their vested interests and the vested interests
of many people for it to fail. The general public doesn't listen
because there is no one effectively communicating about this &ndash; and
business doesn't want it and people and the engineering
establishment are disingenuous about this.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health</strong> &ndash; In their quest to control and
subdue people, they have ruined mental health for people in the
modern world. Statistics show that mental health is worse for the
young than many times before. They produce damaging drugs, push
them on kids and people, and create, overtly create, the conditions
that ruin people, low income, a messed up culture, perverse
capitalism, social dominance and subjugation, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Nuclear weapons</strong> &ndash; Since the 1940s, the
engineering establishment has put humanity in peril and under their
thumb &ndash; they made humanity their bitch.</p>

<p>The fake fear of the cold war and nuclear armageddon put
humanity under the whim of high level engineers and so called
scientists who seek to undemocratically dominate the world.</p>

<p><strong>AI</strong> &ndash; In recent times, there is another new
threat, a product of engineers, actually useful (as opposed to
nuclear bombs), but much more dangerous and strange. That is AI,
and it is both a blessing and a curse.</p>

<p>But, if the engineers, who operate on the basis of the worst
qualities that people have, continues unabated and unfought, then
it is quite plausible that a Terminator-like situation would come
about, quite knowingly and gleefully in the eyes of some cold
creatures in an ivory tower and glasses.</p>

<p>They have everything under their grasp, and it is quite possible
that a clique of elites would tolerate this because it would enrich
themselves and their rich and powerful friends.</p>

<p>At the expense of humanity.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it would be political, and the robots would be
targeted at a specific county, race, or group of people.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see a Christian or a LGBT Holocaust.
But does anyone want this??</p>

<p>These people unequivocally hate democracy, unless they are in
charge, then they pretend its presence in most cases.</p>

<p>Democracy &ndash; which many consider a face, only can exist in the
context of humility, of self-reflection, of down-to-earthness.</p>

<p>These people are NOT down to earth. They degrade people all the
time.</p>

<p>They act on the level of 3-year-olds, smirking to themselves,
only permitting or acknowledging as “existing” or “relevant” their
thoughts.</p>

<p>They are completely unqualified, have zero credentials ever,
have zero credentials I wish to repeat, and are unequivocally
nobodies. It's time people beat them into submission, literally and
figuratively.</p>

<p>They should adhere to high logic and to the highest
mathematicians' premises. NOT vested interests. NOT the military
industrial complex (which is their fault). Not to Big Pharma (which
is their fault). Not to any other interests.</p>

<p>The “spell” that people fall under, more so than wokeism,
MAGA-ism or other supposed ills, is the dictate of the engineering
establishment &ndash; they are wholly undemocratic.</p>

<p>They don't tolerate speech other than that which they deem okay.
This establishment is actually a combination of a number of
different establishments, many of which people hate, some examples
of which would be, the military industrial complex and Big
Pharma.</p>

<p>The fake news mainstream media, which is really fake, whether
your a liberal or conservative, Marxist or libertarian, is dictated
by the cultural whims of these creeps, the engineering
establishment. They despise free discourse, and put in place
draconian laws to curtail speech and stifle liberties. For
instance, hate speech laws. So called “hate speech” might be the
only way to overcome these people, to get them to at least somewhat
listen. It doesn't matter if one is a far-left Democrat or a
far-right Republican, this is all the same.</p>

<p>If you want to say something out of line? That wouldn't be
tolerated, and you would get fired or not get a degree or not get
into a university at all. You might lose your non-university job.
You might be in poverty. And this is okay.</p>

<p>Is it expressly, EXPLICITLY OKAY to be in poverty to fight
this.</p>

<p>The mainstream engineering establishment perpetuates the lie
that money matters, that money is all that matters, that conformity
happens and is the way of things (they act like it's immutable),
that one should get a higher paying job and submit wholly to norms,
that their backwards, limited form of capitalism is all that
matters, that love, empathy, the decency of the individual, don't
matter.</p>

<p>They don't listen. The proper solution to someone smirking and
acting in an ivory tower is literal human violence.</p>

<p>And this is the solution.</p>

<p>Ones other alternative is the continuation of the last 300
years.</p>

<p>Could you imagine the American revolution happening without
violence? Or any revolution you may favor?</p>

<p>One of their recent fake creations was the idea of "human
rights".</p>

<p>This can about in the aftermath of WW2, which was their war,
with the support of the UN, which is their group.</p>

<p>The idea is that &ndash; people should be woke enough to not stand up
for injustices, that people should be passive and tolerate THEIR
fake “development” of the world and world affairs.</p>

<p>Is the world safer since WW2? In any way? Or better?</p>

<p>Are you richer?</p>

<p>Their typical modus operandi is "shut up and listen &ndash; we control
things". They abound in Greek and Latin terms, which, while many
people have grown an affection for, are arbitrary artifacts of
ancient and barbaric times.</p>

<p>Their basis is PRE-ENLIGHTENMENT &ndash; PRE-ENLIGHTENMENT GREECE,
PRE-ENLIGHTENMENT ROME.</p>

<p>They don't have modern ideas or principles in their DNA. The old
must be purged.</p>

<p>Because these people hate democracy so much, they are actively
selling out to China, which doesn't even have a fake pretense of
“human rights,” it just demands submission, something they surely
relate to very well.</p>

<p>They have spent decades now giving jobs to the Chinese and
turbo-charging their growth.</p>

<p>The major different between the West and China is, in the West,
we can speak out, at least in theory against this establishment. In
China, you will get executed. If we sell out to China, opposing
this becomes much harder.</p>

<p>Which is why it is time to opposite this NOW and fight this
NOW.</p>

<p>We need a democratic engineering establishment and academic
establishment that operates in adherence to high logic from
mathematicians in regards to operation; tolerates dissenting views;
supports proper moral values; supports democracy; acknowledges the
revolutionary potential of people and supports it [to fight for
good]; tolerates free speech and open debate on subjects like
psychiatry and Scientology (and god you know they can't do it right
now, have that conversation, they'll physically run away from you
in person, then start yelling into the air without context or
reason, completely immature) and the macroeconomic implications of
that &ndash; how this would affect mental health, mass sales, etc.; is
relatively more laid back than the current engineering
establishment and open to alternate viewpoints and approaches in
regards to the creation of things &ndash; bridges, electronics, drugs,
anything.</p>

<p>Every action besides raw violence is probably untenable with
these people. Try a more peaceful approach first or alongside the
violent approach. Don't be afraid to get arrested or in legal
trouble. I reiterate that.</p>

<p>I got in legal trouble in 2022 for the first time, I mingled
with some bad people, that perhaps I shouldn't have. Do I regret
it? No. Because all too often, people think that certain things are
“scams” or “non scams” &ndash; blindly blocking out nuance or thought
about certain things. This is one of the biggest mental blocks
people have. They auto-brand things: “scam” or “non-scam.” I
“can't” do _________ because..... But they CAN do _________. They
CAN do that thing.</p>

<p>But they think they can't.</p>

<p>And you CAN take the plunge into new things, into defiance, into
individuality, into supporting worthwhile causes, into rejecting
friends and associates, into become the true you, into candid
sincerity, into finding your true self, into knowledge, into
research, into truth, into revolt.</p>

<p>If cutting ties with these types makes a better you, then you
can do that.</p>

<p>No one should tell you that you “can't” do something, even
getting arrested.</p>

<p>As an important last note: and this is important. When people assume
conformity, when a man assumes his mistress must have sex with him,
and she is socially pressured, when there is group agreement about
“the way of the world” or the “way something works,” one should
know this:</p>
<br>

<p><strong>When violence is exerted, it acts as an effective
substitute for that which one is socially told they cannot
express.</strong></p>
<br>

<p>This goes for liberals or conservatives.</p>

<p>It should be no surpise that the violent get nearly deified
when their tactics work &ndash; look at communist revolutionaries or
North Korea or George Washington. When people fight (to be able to
live and do the most foundational thing besides eating and sleeping -
speaking and expressing thoughts) and create a land that is somehow “free” -
those people get practically deified.</p>

<p>If the woman slapped her would-be rapist, if the slave attacks
his slavemaster, if the common folk attacks the engineer or the
engineering establishment with force or a show of force, it
effectively opens the door to an increased range of discourse and a
more democratic set of circumstances. This, then, opens the door to
an equitable, fair, democratic process.</p>

<p>This is why things like January 6 or liberal protests can be
valuable and effective. Because liberals and conservatives try to
shut each other up, and sometimes people's eyes need to be
opened.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is imperative that people in their 30s, 40s and 50s, and later years,
the “seasoned engineer” or the “professional” with “20 years experience”
or someone who has “settled” to engage in a self-determined, open-minded
and rationally-skeptical deprogramming in their lives &ndash; and be willing to be in a
mental context that would be more conducive to disagreeing with the mainstream
engineering establishment and bring about a true and honest range of discourse
about all matters &ndash; not just a cherry-picked selection of topics “of interest”
to be told to be curious about (most of which are nonsensical, just look at
the front page of Hacker News, for example).</p>

<p>As with any deprogramming of any Cult &ndash; non forcible means are ideal.</p>

<p>Only this cult is the most thoroughgoing and widespread cult that has ever existed.
And fighting against it might make you go almost sick.</p>

<hr>

<p>As for non-Western centric perspectives, this applies just as much in a Chinese and Indian context &ndash; more so in some cases.</p>

<p>However, what is quite interesting about these examples
is that, since Indians and Chinese live in developing countries, the powers-that-be would be less reflexive of squashing dissent &ndash; nothing
is “wholly settled” with a fake “consensus,” and so there might be more of an open mind to challenging the established authority (the West)
by trying different approaches. There is more potential of a macro-revolt in China, presumably,
in this particular regard, unless the West demonstrates a macro-grassroots movement, which has not happened yet, but is possible. There are
certainly a lot more rich people in the West than in the East, and the West has much more to lose. Moreover, when one is sanctimonious, one
then divorces oneself from reality. One becomes obsessed with maintaining an image. The Chinese and Asian countries are used to the dirt,
only the West has had its head held up high.</p><div class='article_link'><a href="index.html">Previous article</a>
