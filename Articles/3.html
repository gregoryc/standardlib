<h2><i>And in so doing, gain love, empathy, compassion, gratitude, a sharing mindset, and live up to the true nature of your moral and ethical foundation.</i></h2> <h2>By G.C.</h2>
<p>I use the word “Deprogram,” quite literally, for the Mainstream Engineering Establishment is more extreme, more influential, and more wide-pervasive than any other “Cult” or religious movement. Actually, it's more powerful than Christianity and Islam combined, and dominates in society over any religion or ideology. To be clear &ndash; it is the mainstream ideology that is put in place by force and which people are compelled to submit to through economic and social duress.</p>

<p>Actually, the vices that it creates, create many of the so-called “issues” with mainstream organized religion itself. Mostly, those vices are just its vices &ndash; the people that create the ships, create the swords, the masons, the manufacturers, the engineers &ndash; have a long secretive and proprietary tradition of hiding things, manipulating others, and abusing circumstances for their advantage. It's hard to consider that priests alone could harm others, it is only in the presence of the people that actually create the objects we use, the technologies we use, have the know-how to make them, and set up our modern world, that high powers go corrupt &ndash; and, indeed, they give the means by which TO become corrupt. And so things have gone through history. But the same Greek and Latin traditions remain &ndash; from two millennia ago, where slavery was rampant and when there were dictators. <i>The rights of all men</i> &ndash; was a foreign concept.</p>

<p>One of the recent things that has happened was that they pitted people against religion in the West, presumably to divide people and conquer people. Such certainly happened &ndash; millions of people died in the 30 Years War and all of the religious conquests.</p>

<p>This has led to an ideological hatred of religion &ndash; divorced from reason.</p>

<p>Anything new that they have not yelled at, “debated” thoroughly &ndash; they brand a cult or something. The have created a notion of “secularism” whereby they seek to divide the minds of man and separate the ideals of engineering with the norms of a religious context &ndash; not on the basis of reason but on the basis of ideology. There is a fake notion of “science” &ndash; that “everyone knows everything always” &ndash; which is unequivocally not true, readily debunked, promulgated by the most secret and proprietary individuals &ndash; hypocritically &ndash; is more of an academic propaganda line or an opiate for the weak than something that would be sincerely taken seriously by any group of individuals. This plainly cannot be true &ndash; and this pseudo-skepticism is very harmful. “Science” is not a glittery thing that exists everywhere, catering to the brightest minds with a cute hugging face &ndash; having your Safety and Security and best interests in mind. No, it is not that way.</p>

<p>Going back to the ideas of “Cults” &ndash; anything new since the chaos they had created is branded separate “from the collective” &ndash; the notion of “universalism” is abused on multiple fronts. They act as if their angry, vitriolic assertions apply for all &ndash; that some people are “always bad,” “always degraded,” “cannot” do things, should “never” talk to someone, should “never” show compassion, empathy, or brotherhood with a given individual, should “never” be close to an individual, should “never” support someone with money, etc.</p>

<p>They brand anything new a “Cult” &ndash; the Mormon movement, the Scientology movement, MAGA-ism, woke-ism, anything (and the mainstream engineering establishment is responsible for BOTH anti-MAGA AND anti-woke hysteria).</p>

<p>In the context of Scientology, the mainstream engineering establishment has perverted the foundation of that body of findings, has TURNED it into a religion from non-religion, both literally and metaphorically, and, indeed, maybe many criticisms are merited, but these criticisms are closet criticisms of the mainstream engineering establishment itself in addition. The “institutional” criticisms are categorically irrelevant &ndash; Scientology is a bunch of findings about the mind &ndash; fucked up and bastardized by the mainstream engineering establishment &ndash; relegated to a “religious context” (forced into it) &ndash; because the mainstream engineering establishment wants to be “separate” &ndash; wants separation of peoples and a lack of unity. They cannot justify this based on reason or any moral framework or even common sense, so it is done through propaganda, sensationalism, and outright dominance (as in, if you do a scientific study, we will reject you. If you support Engineering (the ideal), we will reject you, fire you, you will lose your livelihood, your wife will leave you, your kids will leave you, your friends will argue with you).</p>

<p>Here are some Invalid criticisms:</p>

<ul>
<li style="padding:12px;">It's a cult! (Vitriol, sensationalism, superficial, no-science, no-nuance, non-scholarly, unequivocally anti-empirical, not wanting things to be tested in general)</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">"The organization" does _____________ (!!!!!) &ndash; Irrelevant. This is worse than people whining about COVID vaccine (I actually heard, THIS IS NOT SCIENCE!!!!!! THIS IS SCIENTOLOGY!!!!!! IT'S NOT SCIENCE. [about COVID]) &ndash; (reasons for invalid criticism &ndash; lacking empathy, hating Enlightenment values and science)</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">"It cant be done because it's (so) secret[ive]" &ndash; Now, this is just disinformation &ndash; an outright lie &ndash; all the information is readily available to be tested and can be torrented &ndash; there is a minority that cannot &ndash; such is not important or foundational. I should reiterate this likes 10 times &ndash; however, right now, I'm not focusing on the advocacy of scientific integrity&mdash;a worthwhile cause &ndash; in the case of COVID, in the case of Scientology, in the case of engineering&mdash;but, in this article, am mainly talking about Deprogramming from the Mainstream Scientific Establishment Cult.</li>

</ul>

<p>Here are some Valid comments.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding:12px;">"Alright, we have here a body of findings about the mind, let's see the efficacy of it &ndash; force a group discourse on it &ndash; stymie stupidity and sensationalism, change bits if we have to, not give a damn about any legal or copyright fake-worries. See how it applies to Biotech. Get Vivek Ramaswamy to talk about it."</li>

<li style="padding:12px;">"Hmm, okay, so apparently there's a building where there is technology based upon NASA tech to train astronauts &ndash; this is unequivocally true &ndash; and yet the mainstream news media is mostly not talking about this. Okay, let's redefine, in a non-partisan way, our scholarly interrelationship between Religion and Engineering &ndash; the old interpretation is outmoded now &ndash; unequivocally &ndash; it is old. NASA and Religion. Hmm."</li>

<li style="padding:12px;">"Let's try to debunk it wholly and take the useful findings and increase mental health care for all. Crack down on it wholly, outlaw it, change psychiatry to include tech based on NASA tech (modern Scientology tech as has existed since the 1970s)."</li>

<li style="padding:12px;">Secular humanists maybe want to outlaw it? Fine. You can do that. But, secular humanists, as distinct from the mainstream engineering establishment, probably wouldn't want to do this &ndash; it would be too “effective” and “definitive.” Instead, such people would want sensationalism to “win” and everyone to be divorced from reason. But this is another argument &ndash; and not my main argument here (my criticism of the mainstream engineering establishment &ndash; which is not the same thing as secular humanism &ndash; at all &ndash; however, it perverts secular humanists and makes them neither “secular” nor “humanist” &ndash; and ruins the philosophy, as pure as it might look at first glance. The issues that have ruined secularism humanism or “atheism” are the same issues that have ruined Scientology &ndash; this perverse coupling with the mainstream engineering establishment. And both get tons of hate and are actually in the same camp, whether they admit it or not, in many, many ways.</li>

<li style="padding:12px;">Another alternative is to not have an issue with it and let it grow and take over the world &ndash; the church, specifically. This could work. Or it could be outlawed and secular humanists could be given dictate over the affairs of the West &ndash; this could also work &ndash; but ONLY if it's findings are tested and used &ndash; and not divorced by the severely mentally challenged or full-autistic. Enough retards squirm or get introverted on this subject, they cannot be supported. Science should be science.</li>

</ul>

<p><big>So that's an essay about “Cults.” In the following article we will talk about deprogramming from this cult &ndash; the mainstream engineering establishment &ndash; which is far worse than Scientology or Atheism or Islam or Christianity or Wokeism or MAGA-ism or Jim Jones or actual death-cults &ndash; <i>far worse</i>.</big></p><div class='article_link'><a href="2.html">Previous article</a>
