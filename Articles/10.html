<h1>The Fight</h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>

<p>With Foundationallib, I am striving for perfection, but also
Ubiquity.</p>

<p>The previous articles, along with this, should unequivocally
explain why this software library should indeed be UBIQUITOUS.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is unimportant that I made it completely. It doesn't
matter WHO made it. It is in the public domain for anyone to use
and modify.</p>

<p>It is not about status or prestige or thinking I'm great or any
such thing. It is about REASON and LOGIC (see article 1 and 6).</p>

<p>I intend to make this library perfect and applicable for all use
cases, all while not introducing any bloat &ndash; meaning it should be
perfect on embedded and high end desktops and servers -
everywhere.</p>

<p>The fight is not about THIS library or MY library, it's for what
the previous article talked about &ndash; those ideals.</p>

<p>IDEAL SPEED &ndash; INCLUDING NO EXCESSIVE OPERATIONS</p>

<p>IDEAL OPERATION &ndash; ALL ERRORS CHECKED UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT
SUCH</p>

<p>PROPER CUSTOMIZATION</p>

<p>MINIMAL MEMORY USAGE &ndash; WHEN IT MATTERS</p>

<p>Moreover, on a more human basis, I want to:</p>

<p>Enable people to use computers properly.</p>

<p>Enable people to operate ably &ndash; to the maximum degree of
ability. This, sometimes, when people use computers, would involve
having there be code for a custom operation not handled by a
certain set of programs.</p>

<p>Conquer fundamental goals that people have and help others
to.</p>

<p>I welcome all quality communications, contributions and feedback
from people &ndash; in tests, new code, donations, validation, security,
good ideas, good advice, etc.</p>
