<h1>Nonsense - And On Speech and Democracy</h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>
<p>There is a lot of nonsense in the world and in the mainstream engineering establishment.</p>

<p>It can be very difficult, if not seemingly impossible, to get a word in edgewise with many people.</p>

<p>There is a major issue of having a limited range of discourse (in politics, choice-making affairs, etc.).</p>

<br><br><br>
<center><h4>On Government and Gerontocracy</h4></center>


<p>A Gerontocracy would likely be a better form of Government and it seems that the young are all too eager to exacerbate issues with Government and Democracy, in a myriad of ways.</p>


<p>Here are some ways</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li style="padding:12px;">They look young and clean, demonstrating charisma, charm, "popularity" (and it's attendant superficialities) and deception over authenticity, candor and verbose and unpalatable or unpopular speech or discussions.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">They have more energy, and are all the more likely to use it sloppily, dangerously or unwisely.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">They have less experience and knowledge and wisdom, leading to worse outcomes.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">They might even seem less formidable or intimidating to adversaries or peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Democracy, and this is often overlooked, there is a
major <i>MECHANICAL</i> issue, and that is of the <i>MECHANICS</i> of increasing the degree of new ideas put out there.</p>

<p>There is a misconception that this automatically "happens", even in a "free" democracy. At its root, this is a struggle of interpersonal
relations and only happens to the extent that this is not stifled or made more difficult by social and individual barriers.</p>

<p>The young are worse at improving this, the old are better at improving this.</p>

<p>The majority of ideas are impeded from public discourse by old social obstructionism or lack of individual strength.</p>

<p>If someone might want to suggest an idea, the mainstream conversation impedes individuals from feeling empowered to express their thoughts or feel like a member of the current discourse ("current discourse" is being used here in a very general sense).</p>

<p>People who stutter or stammer, and this happens to many people, a large portion of people, to varying degrees, actually would be the force that could push through this and lead to a broader discussion.</p>

<p>Usually, the vital elements are omitted, the things that should be talked about don't get talked about. In actual fact, the general conversation is less than 1% of the Conversation that should happen.</p>

<p>People who stutter &ndash;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either have a disability (to varying degrees)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or are trying to break the mold here and open the conversation, and, of course, naturally, they will not be able to conceive of their ideas being reciprocated, hence mandating a stutter, if it's not present due to a disability of some kind.</p>

<p>Even disabled people, not having to seem polished, in many ways are more potent for Discourse, than a gleaming figure who doesn't try to fight to get ideas (new or old), heard.</p>
