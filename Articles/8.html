<h1><span>Logical Direction</span></h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>
People need to think of things more logically.

factors)</td>

Ability.</td>

techne.</td>

<td class='p'>Postulate 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;—</td>
<td>We should maximize machines to increase our level of operation,
within ethical limits perhaps, aligning with our main real goals
and subgoals (which are not necessarily all stated here)</td>

<td class='p'>Postulate 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;—</td>
<td>Machines are limited by as fast as they can move.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='goal'>Sub Goal 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;—</td>

their highest potential</td>
</tr>

<td class='problem'>Sub Problem 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;—</td>
<td>Our problem, then, is to remove from existence all things that
get in the way of having machines operate well, which, in turn,
aligns with our goals of being able to operate, which in turn
aligns with our goal of surviving well.</td>

<p>It is very important that people evaluate all the choices they
make.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<i>
<p>Why do I have a cat? Is it logical? Am I weak?</p>

<p>Why have I been working this career for 40 years? All my money
is going to waste and I'm the CEO. Things are going to hell, and I
feel miserable even though I have the best pillow.</p>

<p>Am I safe?</p>

<p>How do I get less overwhelmed by my friends? They are too
harsh.</p>

<p>Joe is not allowing me to speak ever. What do I do?</p>

<p>I have this great thing and the mainstream engineering
establishment is refusing to converse about it, let alone monetize
it to help people's bottom lines. What do I do?</p>

<p>Why do I keep using this slow scripting language when it's not
ideal and makes no sense?</p>

<p>Why do I keep treating my peers bad?</p>

<p>Who is in charge of creating robots? Will they destroy us? Can
we have a lighthearted friendly chat with these blokes?</p>

<p>What's the point of becoming a millionaire at the expense of
everything?</p>

<p>Are nukes going to destroy us all? Who controls them? Can we
chat with them?</p>

<p>Can AI enhance dynamic individuality?</i> (This is a good one.)</p><div class='article_link'><a href="7.html">Previous article</a>
