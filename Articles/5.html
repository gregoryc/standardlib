<h1>Analysis of the Broken “Engineering Establishment Mindset”</h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>

<p>The mainstream engineer is unequivocally in a very, very broken
culture.</p>

<p>This culture is leading to many significant problems in the
world (see also: <a href="1.html"><strong>The Problem
with the Mainstream Engineering Establishment</strong></a> on this
blog/site.)</p>

<p>But what is their mindset and why is it so dangerous and why
must it be opposed to absolutely forcefully and vehemently?</p>

<p>To start with, in no way is it democratic and in no way is it
inspired by reason and French- and American-inspired Enlightenment
Values.</p>

<p>It is based on authoritarian conformity. And as such, it is
based on upholding nonsense traditions &ndash; I am not using such as an
insult, but by “nonsense,” I mean, a lack of high level reason in
accordance with mathematics or trying to solve a high-level problem
(see: <a href="1.html"><strong>The Problem with the
Mainstream Engineering Establishment</strong></a>).</p>

<p>It upholds nonsense, people build new skyscrapers while everyone
at half the height of the skyscraper and lower is burning &ndash; burning
with thousands of problems, problems the mainstream engineering
establishment is knowingly creating and supporting and is cognizant
of.</p>

<p>The people in charge in the mainstream engineering establishment
know of and actively WANT these problems, because these problems
lead to submission and conformity to them. Engineers are people who
plan and create our world &ndash; it is created flawed on purpose be the
complacent and the deeply antidemocratic and corrupt.</p>

<p>The only solution, because speaking is unlikely to work &ndash; is to
fight back, with literal force and violence, ideally in a
macro-organized way, by means of communication channels such as the
internet, in order to fight back at this. Occupy Wall Street is a
disgrace, and perhaps, a conspiracy theorist might even think was
staged. This movement didn't do much to fight back.</p>
<h2>Now, this is a big thing:</h2>

<p><strong>When people assume conformity, when a man assumes his
mistress must have sex with him, and she is socially pressured by
him and feels near-powerless to disagree or express dissent &ndash; when
there is group agreement about “the way of the world” or the "way
something works", one should know this:</strong></p>

<p><strong>When violence is exerted, it acts as an effective
substitute for that which one is socially told they cannot
express.</strong></p>

<p>This goes for liberals or conservatives.</p>

<p>If the woman slapped her would-be rapist, if the slave attacks
his slavemaster, if the common folk attacks the engineer or the
engineering establishment with force or a show of force, it
effectively opens the door to an increased range of discourse and a
more democratic set of circumstances. This, then, opens the door to
an equitable, fair, democratic process.</p>

<p>This is why things like January 6 or liberal protests can be
valuable and effective. Because liberals and conservatives try to
shut each other up, and sometimes people's eyes need to be
opened.</p>

<p>It is a conformity-culture, and this is all they know, it really
is and if you speak out they yell at you. It is important to ALWAYS
step over them and get the last word &ndash; like whack-a-mole.</p>

<p>Indeed, these individuals are vermin and deserve to be gassed or
killed unequivocally. Not from a partisan standpoint, but on the
basis of mathematics and reason.</p>

<p>Let's be quite candid here: There is just no point to
working-your-way-up and becoming a billionaire in Biotech or some
field or whatever, and acting like a gleaming ray of light, when
the same vileness would continue. They are not listening to you.
They don't want to listen to you. And you will be complicit in not
fighting back, this will be YOUR sin, not necessarily theirs, and
your complacency will be your biggest fault. Then, if or when a
nuclear bomb gets dropped, your family might die, your business
might crash and go into pieces, all because you were being "Mr.
Clean" or “Ms. Clean” and trying to not get a criminal record or
trying to not get legal charges. This will have been your fault.
<i>Be willing to get messy.</i> Be willing to be defiant. Be
willing to go into poverty, have your wife leave you, be hungry. I
have certain been hungry on many occasions. A "gleaming beacon of
smiles" isn't saving anyone, it's lying to people. <strong>It's
lying to people.</strong> And these smiley types deserve, quite
possibly, terrible treatment, the law in many cases is backwards.
It rewards people who don't fight for good causes, and penalizes
people who act in a heroic fashion. Whatever you think of them,
think of Martin Luther King Jr. or Nelson Mandela. These people got
punished by the law for trying to make the world a better place. I
also got punished by the law for trying to make the world a better
place. And so should you. The legal system is rigged and unfair. It
rewards criminals and complacency. It punishes free speech and
fighting back. It punishes doing the right thing.</p>

<p>The victims of this culture act in the following ways</p>
