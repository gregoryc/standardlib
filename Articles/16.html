<h1>In the beginning, there is no Ontology. Nothing exists.</h1>

<h1>In the beginning, there is this. We posit this. These are attributes.</h1>
</div>


<p>* Existence (no self-ontology)</p>

<p>* Concreteness (no self-ontology)</p>

<p>* Anti-existence (which is anti-ontology [for others and self too (it would be anti-ontology for attributes (if they existed), and anti- the existence of all things)])  (no self-ontology)</p>

<p>* Anti-concreteness (for others and self too [it would be anti-concreteness for attributes (if they had concreteness), and anti- the concreteness of all things])  (no self-ontology)</p>

<p>All of these attributes have no ontology. They don’t exist.</p>

<p>They are attributes, but they are not attributes of anything
that exists. There is no ontology at this level, nothing exists.</p>

<p>It is possible that other attributes are also present in the
beginning, but they are not relevant and it wouldn’t matter if they
were present or not.</p>

<p>Anti-existence and anti-concreteness both work, but are super
vague.</p>

<p>They both fail at their goals, leading to both existence and
concreteness.</p>

<p>Therefore something that has ontological existence comes into
existence for the first time, with extremely low (possibly
infinitesimal concreteness).</p>

<p>In trying to make things not exist in the most abstract and
poorly defined way, and in trying to get things not to be concrete
in the most abstract and poorly defined way, they make something
exist.</p>

<p>This is Numbers or “numberness” or “numbernessness,” etc. in
probably the most abstract or one of the most abstract ways
possible.</p>

<p>Numberness combined with the super-abstract anti-existence and
anti-concreteness again fail to interact and produce
positionness.</p>

<p>Positionness again fails to interact with those things and
produces positions, multiple positions that have ontological
significance. Probably a very large number of positions would be
produced.</p>

<p>Positionness interacting with those things produces
groupness.</p>

<p>Groupness interacts with those two things, which Try to remove
the groupness from existence.</p>

<p>Those things fail, and produce the content of groups, in
probably a very abstract way.</p>

<p>In the production of the content of groups, the following things
happen.</p>

<p>Elimination necessitation</p>

<p>Firstly, to appease “The Eliminator” (a synonym for
Simplification, Reductionism, Mathematics,</p>

<p>Destructionism or Elimination, all of which are synonymous), the
relationship between the two or more “things” needs to be defined
clearly and explicitly. To do this, one requisite is that there
needs to be a set, singular ordering of the two or more “things,”
no going back, no changing. The “things” go in a specific
order.</p>

<p>Therefore | The ordering gets established, perhaps arbitrarily,
in line with the way that “The Eliminator” does it.</p>

<p>Elimination necessitation | But the ordering can't be justified
to the Eliminator as making sense, without an observer. The
observer would have the effect of validating and justifying the
rather arbitrary ordering. To the observer, the ordering is the
proper ordering, and no other ordering would be proper.</p>

<p>Therefore | An observer comes about, first partially, then
completely after the following process happens (think of it like a
recursive function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>Awareness, of the validity of the ordering comes about, in order
to justify the ordering to The Eliminator (or Simplification, or
Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the same thing) first
partially, then completely after the following process happens
(think of it like a recursive function call in computer
programming)</p>

<p>Awareness comes about as an attribute of the observer, in order
to justify the ordering (again) to “The Eliminator” (or
Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the
same thing), first partially, then completely after the following
process happens (think of it like a recursive function call in
computer programming).</p>

<p>(Commentary: Spinoza, a man accused of as being an atheist,
believed that everything was “mind.” This is called idealism in
philosophy, an idea that is not necessarily a religious one, and
not necessarily a superstitious one. This is where “mind” would
first come about. Later in the process, “mental health” comes about
as well. This would be necessary for “mind.”)</p>

<p>Awareness of awareness comes about as an attribute of the
observer, in order to justify the ordering (again) to “The
Eliminator” (or Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism—
these are all the same thing), first partially, then completely
after the following process happens (think of it like a recursive
function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>Commentary: The observer is also aware that they are aware.</p>

<p>An incessant extension of the ordering comes about, as a
“background process,” if you will, to make the ordering not be
finite, and therefore make sense.</p>

<p>Each next item is one greater than the previous item.</p>

<p>First this happens partially, then completely after the
following process happens (think of it like a recursive function
call in computer programming).</p>

<p>There is an alteration of the awareness of the observer; the
amount of awareness has new ontological attributes of itself come
about as attributes of the observer, in order to justify the
ordering (again) to “The Eliminator” (or Simplification, or
Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the same thing), first
partially, then completely after the following process happens
(think of it like a recursive function call in computer
programming).</p>

<p>Commentary:</p>

<p>Therefore | it could appear as if there were such things as
“moments,” to the observer.</p>

<p>Therefore | it could appear as if there were “time,” to the
observer.</p>

<p>Commentary: For the observer to validate the ordering, the
observer would need to be able to “agree”</p>

<p>with sequential things, and “disagree” with nonsequential
things. For the observer to agree with a state with its awareness,
it needs to experience sensation.</p>

<p>9) Thus sensation comes about.</p>

<p>Sensation comes about as an attribute of the observer (or
“being” one could call it, whether or not this being counts as life
or would be a god of some sort is beside the point), in order to
justify the ordering (again) to “The Eliminator” (or
Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the
same thing), first partially, then completely after the following
process happens (think of it like a recursive function call in
computer programming).</p>

<p>“Mental health” comes about as an attribute of the observer (or
“being” one could call it, whether or not this being counts as life
or would be a god of some sort is beside the point), in order to
justify the ordering (again) to “The Eliminator” (or
Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the
same thing), first partially, then completely after the following
process happens (think of it like a recursive function call in
computer programming).</p>

<p>Awareness of unitness of observer (Unitness means the condition
of being “one thing”).</p>

<p>(Commentary: being aware that other observers exist, does not
make them exist, does not make numbers exist, does not make them
concrete and does not make numbers concrete. [Nor does it make
numerals concrete. None of these things exist yet. The other
observers may or may not be aware yet. The other observers may or
may not be aware that they are aware yet.)</p>

<p>Awareness of other observers (non-concrete, non-ontological)
comes about as an attribute of the observer (or “being” one could
call it, whether or not this being counts as life or would be a god
of some sort is beside the point), in order to justify the ordering
(again) to “The Eliminator” (or Simplification, or Mathematics, or
Reductionism— these are all the same thing), first partially, then
completely after the following process happens (think of it like a
recursive function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>Awareness of separateness of other observers (non-ontological)
comes about as an attribute of the observer (or “being” one could
call it, whether or not this being counts as life or would be a god
of some sort is beside the point), in order to justify the ordering
(again) to “The Eliminator” (or Simplification, or Mathematics, or
Reductionism— these are all the same thing), first partially, then
completely after the following process happens (think of it like a
recursive function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>——————————————————————————————</p>

<p>After awareness of the validity of the ordering fully comes
about, and all of the aforementioned steps happen as well, the
following things happen</p>

<p>Awareness of existence (the high-level attribute, no ontology)
comes about as an attribute of the observer (or “being” one could
call it, whether or not this being counts as life or would be a god
of some sort is beside the point), in order to justify the ordering
(again) to “The Eliminator” (or Simplification, or Mathematics, or
Reductionism— these are all the same thing), first partially, then
completely after the following process happens (think of it like a
recursive function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>Awareness of concreteness (high level attribute, no ontology)
comes about as an attribute of the observer (or “being” one could
call it, whether or not this being counts as life or would be a god
of some sort is beside the point), in order to justify the ordering
(again) to “The Eliminator” (or Simplification, or Mathematics, or
Reductionism— these are all the same thing), first partially, then
completely after the following process happens (think of it like a
recursive function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>Awareness of ontological existence of ordering comes about as an
attribute of the observer (or “being” one could call it, whether or
not this being counts as life or would be a god of some sort is
beside the point), in order to justify the ordering (again) to “The
Eliminator” (or Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism—
these are all the same thing), first partially, then completely
after the following process happens (think of it like a recursive
function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>Awareness of concreteness of ordering comes about as an
attribute of the observer (or “being” one could call it, whether or
not this being counts as life or would be a god of some sort is
beside the point), in order to justify the ordering (again) to “The
Eliminator” (or Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism—
these are all the same thing), first partially, then completely
after the following process happens (think of it like a recursive
function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>Awareness that concreteness of ordering is nonzero (greater than
zero) (Concreteness != 0 or Concreteness &gt; 0, Concreteness could
not be negative) comes about as an attribute of the observer (or
“being” one could call it, whether or not this being counts as life
or would be a god of some sort is beside the point), in order to
justify the ordering (again) to “The Eliminator” (or
Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the
same thing), first partially, then completely after the following
process happens (think of it like a recursive function call in
computer programming).</p>

<p>Once those previous 5 steps fully happen, the following starts
to happen</p>

<p>(Awareness then begins to come into existence in other ways that
doesn’t only have to do with the ordering.</p>

<p>This is very, very interesting.)</p>

<p>Awareness of ontological existence of ordering comes about as an
attribute of the observer (or “being” one could call it, whether or
not this being counts as life or would be a god of some sort is
beside the point), in order to justify the ordering (again) to “The
Eliminator” (or Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism—
these are all the same thing), first partially, then completely
after the following process happens (think of it like a recursive
function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>(Commentary: Now that there is 1) awareness, 2) self-awareness,
3) awareness of others, their unitness and separateness and 4)
awareness of the ordering, awareness of others starts to be defined
more accurately, since awareness is early in this simplificational
definition sequence, as listed above. This begins with the
following)</p>

<p>Awareness of Awareness of Awareness — the awareness of (another
observer’s) awareness of awareness— comes about, in order to
justify an observer’s Awareness of Awareness as an attribute of the
observer (or “being” one could call it, whether or not this being
counts as life or would be a god of some sort is beside the point),
in order to justify the ordering (again) to “The Eliminator” (or
Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the
same thing), first partially, then completely after the following
process happens (think of it like a recursive function call in
computer programming).</p>

<p>Awareness of Awareness of Awareness of Awareness — the awareness
of (another observer’s) awareness of (an ordering’s own, to self)
awareness of awareness — comes about, in order to justify an
observer’s Awareness of Awareness (and therefore, mental health and
sensation, since awareness depends on mental health and sensation,
which in effect are synonymous) as an attribute of the observer (or
“being” one could call it, whether or not this being counts as life
or would be a god of some sort is beside the point), in order to
justify the ordering (again) to “The Eliminator” (or
Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the
same thing), first partially, then completely after the following
process happens (think of it like a recursive function call in
computer programming).</p>

<p>Awareness of Awareness of Awareness of Awareness of Awareness (5
“awareness”es)– awareness of (ones own; to self) awareness of the
awareness of (another’s) awareness of (one’s own; to self)
awareness of awareness — comes about, in order to justify an
observer’s own Awareness of Awareness (and therefore, mental health
and sensation, since awareness depends on mental health and
sensation, which in effect are synonymous) as an attribute of the
observer (or “being” one could call it, whether or not this being
counts as life or would be a god of some sort is beside the point),
in order to justify the ordering (again) to “The Eliminator” (or
Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the
same thing), first partially, then completely after the following
process happens (think of it like a recursive function call in
computer programming).</p>

<p>Commentary: 5 awarenesses are all that are necessary. Awareness
of self-awareness is basically the same thing as self-awareness.
This process doesn’t need to go on forever.</p>

<p>Emotion, in order to experience the sensation of agreement comes
about as an attribute of the observer (or “being” one could call
it, whether or not this being counts as life or would be a god of
some sort is beside the point), in order to justify the ordering
(again) to “The Eliminator” (or Simplification, or Mathematics, or
Reductionism— these are all the same thing), first partially, then
completely after the following process happens (think of it like a
recursive function call in computer programming).</p>

<p>An attempt to gain awareness of ontological existence of other
observers comes about as an attribute of the observer (or “being”
one could call it, whether or not this being counts as life or
would be a god of some sort is beside the point), in order to
justify the ordering (again) to “The Eliminator” (or
Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the
same thing), first partially, then completely after the following
process happens (think of it like a recursive function call in
computer programming).</p>

<p>(Commentary, a little bit of a tangent, but bear with me: The
attempt fails, which results in the following. It is not necessary
that the “failure” be ontological. But the attempt doesn’t work.
Also, the ontological existence of the other observers may not may
not be concrete yet, depending on the other observer. This the
first and only true Communication between observers [beings] and is
the only reason things, such as Barack Obama or a chair or a
universe seem to exist.</p>

<p>Spinoza said that everything is “mind.” This “mind” would come
about when “awareness” comes about. Spinoza believed that higher
factors don’t influence lower-level factors. I don’t necessarily
agree with this view, and Spinoza’s claim is unproven. On the basis
of reason and logic and mathematics alone, this book might prove
the opposite.</p>

<p>Spinoza was considered an Atheist in his day (even though this
is kind of not true).</p>

observer (or “being” one could call it, whether or not this being

observer (or “being” one could call it, whether or not this being
counts as life or would be a god of some sort is beside the point),

Simplification, or Mathematics, or Reductionism— these are all the
same thing), first partially, then completely after the following
process happens (think of it like a recursive function call in

<p>Awareness of the attempt to improve mental health of observer
(being), due to the fact that the space and the content in the
universe, as well as the Simplification- or Mathematically- or
Reductionistically- caused reaction to understand the ontology of
other observers (which doesn't ever happen fully) with one or more
other observers, have a negative effect on the observer’s mental
health and sensation, and therefore the observer becomes inclined
to improve their own mental health, and improve their own
sensation. (these two things are basically the same thing.) comes
about as an attribute of the observer (or “being” one could call
it, whether or not this being counts as life or would be a god of

<p>Reset Time (Since events, games, ontological time, and
ontological time streams have partly come into existence and are in
the process of coming into existence, higher-level factors could
reset concrete sequences back to previous states. This is called
“Reset Time” because Time could be thought to reset. It would be an
arbitrary statement to say that time cannot go back. Since games
partly exist, the “dial” of the procession of time, the “variable”
in a C struct, is simply given a lower value, if higher level
factors dictate it. It would suck to have time be resetting all the
time. All personal, “permanent” progress would be lost. For one to
avoid this, one would need to try to control the higher level
factor which would be leading to this. Simply by one exerting
individual influence and by being POTENTIALLY influential or
dangerous to existence and these various factors, one could exert
control. Relation comes into existence before this factor (see
above). Therefore, things are related, in as many ways as possible,
and one can exert influence. If JoJo Siwa were a potential threat
to the human race and wished Death Threats to Xi Jinping and Donald
Trump, and was willing to turn her young fanbase into a cult with
greater zeal and fervor than QAnon, those factors related to JoJo
Siwa and those factors trying to paint JoJo Siwa as an innocent,
innocuous, harmless, young girl, would start to compete with each
other like crazy and would start to do what they could to control
JoJo Siwa more, even though they couldn't. Their “alternatives”
could be shooting her, but that would produce an even bigger
problem. Those factors would get stimulated like hell and would
begin to act differently. They would act in an “appropriate,” "not
corrupt", “sensible,” “liberal,” and “politically correct” way. So,
if she becomes more dangerous to an environment which is already
dangerous, she could produce tremendous influence and increase
discourse. Intelligence agencies could spend a lot of time trying
to sway her action in a direction that “they like.” Any controlling
factors would start altering significantly their course of action,
including negative courses of action. Controlling factors might be
parents, friends, bosses, police, AI, perhaps aliens, perhaps
other-dimensional players. Many, many factors, right now,
regardless of whether or not there are aliens or whether or not
Jesus or Lucifer exist, do certainly care about YOUR future and the
outcome of YOUR life. Police care, governments care. Assuming that
a dystopian condition of “Reset Time” does exist, there are ways of
overcoming it. It would depend upon being very dangerous and being
very willing to communicate and to being very willing to
communicate philosophical statements to people. Look at how
dangerous Karl Marx was. Imagine if JoJo Siwa or Olivia Rodrigo or
Sabrina Carpenter were that dangerous. Imagine of Chinese pop stars
stated "Practice Falun Dafa everyone!!! Democracy for all!!! Death
to the Chinese Communist Party!" An effective way by which one
could exert influence, would be to befriend celebrities. That is
much easier than one becoming a celebrity oneself. Then, one could
get that celebrity to communicate about a certain ideology. The
trick is, one should make that celebrity extremely, extremely
dangerous. Get them to sing about a certain ideology, but do it in
a way that makes them legitimately dangerous. John Lennon wasn't
dangerous to anyone. Michael Jackson might have been, but he wasn't
assassinated. Same with Donald Trump. Same with Barack Obama. The
only people who get assassinated are weak people. Abraham Lincoln
was chronically depressed, he was of weak character and was an
obvious target. Obvious targets will get assassinated, but
important people are never obvious targets. Just because something
bad could happen, doesn't mean that it has to happen or will
happen, otherwise, we would be living in a nuclear fallout right
now. There is a 1,000 page document of incredible detail, which, I
should be clear, I am not supporting and the name and author of
which I am not stating that suggests that people might have been
living in time loops. I don't believe that this dystopian condition
is the case anymore, and I don't think that this something to worry
about, but supposedly there was a time reset about 60 years ago,
after a nuclear war in the height of the Cold War. This would make
sense. If there were too much of an ontological shift, then some
high level factor might reset the sequence that would comprise the
state of the time stream; however, the author of that book was not
in control, nor was he strong, clever, influential or effective,
nor was he unique and he died, ostensibly a suicide, but quite
possibly a murder. He was not strong in character, and he was
needlessly criticizing his own personal faith, and he didn’t
provide methods to Try to overcome Reset Time (which I believe has
since been overcome after the death of this individual; ironically
his initials were KO.) The most effective way to make a celebrity
your friend, would be to make them fall in love with you, and,
failing that, one could Try to make them fall in love with someone
else you know. One could meet them at meet and greets, or other
places. This might be extremely important for maintaining (or
establishing) peace and freedom. ) comes about as an attribute of

<p>Commentary: People put so much emphasis on, put so much money
towards, put so much propaganda towards, caring about a big bang
and creating a “grand degrading narrative,” that people lose touch
of the big picture, and start arrogantly making claims like that
there “is” or “is not” a God, deities, etc., etc.</p>

<p>People should just employ reason and not degrade each other.</p>

<p>Such fixation has been put on an idea of a big bang.</p>

<p>Such denialism has been put on the possibility of other factors
that might exist as well.</p>

<p>Without all of the factors preceding this point, a big bang
cannot exist.</p>

<p>A Big Bang is more like Step 1,000,000 in the process.</p>

<p>An ontological unit of some kind demarks the physical universe
from other ontological units.</p>

<p>Only now in the process, does the physical universe exist.</p>
