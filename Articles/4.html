<h1>How to Deprogram Others From the Mainstream Engineering Establishment &ndash; Or How to Deprogram Yourself (Part 2)</h1>

<h2><i>And in so doing, gain love, empathy, compassion, gratitude, a sharing mindset, and live up to the true nature of your moral and ethical foundation.</i></h2>

<h2>By G.C.</h2>

<div style='text-align: center'><h2>Preface</h2></div>

<br><br>
<div style='text-align: center'><strong>YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW SPECIFICATIONS OR “REQUIREMENTS” &ndash; EVER.</strong></div>
<br><br>

<p>And I mean this as unequivocally and thoroughgoingly as possible &ndash; you can let bridges collapse even. I'm serious.</p>
<p>This is all in line with having the best reasoning ability. If it is more reasonable to not follow “rules,” then do not follow “rules” &ndash; as the case may be &ndash; in line with Reason.</p>

<p>This is one of the biggest traps that exist.</p>

<p>And all some people think with is “Requirements” “Projects” [Circumstance A], [Circumstance B], [Circumstance C], “I'm in a scripting environment,” “I'm in a Cents environment,” “I'm in terrain with an unstable foundation,” “I ....”</p>

<br><br>
<div style='text-align: center'><strong>People get MIRED down into significances, into details, into the unimportant.</strong></div>

<br><br>
<br>
<p>And then they die without having paid attention to anything important.</p>

<p>Many think they can't.</p>
<strong><p>YOU CAN.</p>

<p>OKAY?</p>

<p>YOU CAN.</p></strong>

<p>YOU CAN BASE YOUR LIFE AROUND IMPORTANT THINGS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ONLY FOCUS ON YOUR STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING OR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOB.</p>

<p>Or whatever it is.</p>

<p>Snap out of it.</p>

<p>You can face the big picture. And it's Okay if you're poor.</p>

<div style='text-align: center'><h3>How to Deprogram Others From the Mainstream Engineering Establishment &ndash; Or How to Deprogram Yourself</h3></div>
<strong>
<br><br>
<p>Here is the technique or methodology.</p></strong>

<p>Also, Best-advice from cult-deprogrammers probably is quite valid here.</p>

<p>Be gentle. If there's one thing to do &ndash; be gentle. No coercion should be used on oneself or others. Be gentle.</p>

<p>Be gradual. One can even be iterative &ndash; doing certain portions slowly, and doing things again and again.</p>
<p>It is very imperative that people understand that.</p>
<br><br><br>

<strong>Here is the list.</strong>

<br><br>

<ol>
<li style='padding:12px;'>Recognize that you Exist. (Personal epistemological, almost Descartian thing here. Recognize that you ARE.)</li>

<li style='padding:12px;'>Have individual agency irrespective of and separate from others</li>

<li style='padding:12px;'>Recognize they have choice To Be or Not Be an Engineer at will, and reject all 
 qualities and accept all qualities of being an Engineer at will.</li>

<li style='padding:12px;'>Be completely willing to make a humongous mess or not make a humongous mess at will
in their creations (people have issues on this point, actually neurotic
obsessions on this point &ndash; they are only somewhat justified, usually it's just
immaturity and acting like a grade-schooler &ndash; a lack of personal maturity)</li>

<li style='padding:12px;'>Be completely willing to create in groups creations that would be dynamic, but
potentially very dangerous. For example &ndash; the creation of a laser beam that
could be used for mass change (hypothetical example).</li>

<li style='padding:12px;'>Be completely willing to have personal financial ruin &ndash; and to have ones wife,
husband, family and kids be impoverished along with one &ndash; This point might be
hard for some people &ndash; but it's a high state. Independence of financial obsession
leads to integrity.</li>

<li style='padding:12px;'>Be willing to fight &ndash; metaphorically and literally &ndash; physically &ndash; to fight for good,
to fight against what is not right.</li>

<li style='padding:12px;'>To increase your analytical abilities and creations above the status quo, for all,
collectively. The mainstream engineering establishment doesn't understand GNU
principles &ndash; it doesn't understand Judeo-Christian principles &ndash; it doesn't understand
“secular humanist principles” &ndash; it doesn't understand any moral principles.</li>

<li style='padding:12px;'>Find what you truly believe &ndash; philosophically. It doesn't matter where you're from,
think of the Beatles or Steve Jobs &ndash; they went to India and had
a spiritual experience. Find your true self &ndash; but only on the basis of Reason and analytical abilities,
if you base this on just emotion, your life will be wasted.
