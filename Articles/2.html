<h1>Computer Art and Computer Science</h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>

<p>There is a great deal of difference between “Computer Art” and
“Computer Science.” What most people who call themselves "computer
scientists" do is “computer art” &ndash; they don't operate in accordance
with high mathematical principles in terms of human operation.</p>

<p>True “computer science” would be something like &ndash; finding the
top 10 or 15 categories of a string replace algorithm and making an
optimally fast function for each one, in each different categories,
platforms, constraints, circumstances. There is a minimal
set of categories, and one can optimize for each one and have an
ideal algorithm for each one.</p>

<p>Some examples would be:</p>

<p>The ideal, pure best one if you have memory constraints; the
ideal, pure best one if you don't have memory constraints and care
about performance; the ideal, pure best one if you know the length
of the strings before; etc.</p>

<p>This would be scientific because it would be in accordance with
high level mathematics &ndash; mathematics is a science.</p>

<p>This is NOT what most programmers do. Most programmers do ad hoc
for-the-situation solutions because they are operating “in a job”
“to get paid” "in accordance with the [mainstream engineering
establishment] “system.”</p>

<p>This is dangerous and untenable for many, many reasons.</p>

<p>Here are some issues with this.</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding:12px;">It's illogical art &ndash; that could cause major crashes and issues,
and kill people.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">

<p style='text-indent:0px;'>It promotes illogic &ndash; it promotes nonsense and chaos &ndash; which
most programmers are immersed in &ndash; just have a look at reddit.</p>

<p style='text-indent:0px;'>Most programmers are a combination of the most vile human
qualities that could possibly exist in every aspect.</p>

<p style='text-indent:0px;'>This does not have to be the case and should not be the
case.</p>

<p style='text-indent:0px;'>Indeed, programmers ought to be the most able and most powerful
people on the planet.</p>
</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">It's slow. Instead of a C solution or an assembly solution,
they might use a scripting language, which might make it be
100-1000x slower, depending on the circumstances.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">It's impure. There's an elegance to doing something “properly.”
This is not it.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">It violates don't-repeat-yourself and don't-reinvent-the-wheel
principles.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">
It wastes everyone's time &ndash; unless you are a programmer just for
the sake of a job, in which case, I unequivocally don't support you
and support the entrepreneurs and dynamic individuals involved
instead. I could never imagine thinking like this.
</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">It's slow and is morally poor to all parties involved because
you are coming up with a solution that runs perhaps hundreds of
times less efficiently and with hundreds of times more power than
it should.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">It's not flexible. If you want to change one thing, your slow
solution will take 200 times longer and you can't play around with
it as much. This is not ideal.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">It doesn't help others. See Richard Stallman's material on
this, etc.</li><div class='article_link'><a href="1.html">Previous article</a>
