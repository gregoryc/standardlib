<h1><span>The Myth of the Perfect Child</span></h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>

<p>Parents think that they want to have a perfect child who will be
raised “perfectly” and follow all the norms and be squeaky clean
and follow all the rules and become a doctor, lawyer, or
engineer.</p>

<p>This is highly deluded.</p>

<p>Indeed, it might be worth it, potentially, to just not have the
child in the first place.</p>

<p>This world is horribly corrupt. Raising a kid in this broken
world is very dangerous. Moreover, you're raising a sociopath or
quasi-sociopath. Anyone who follows the status quo of the school
system is likely half-broken if not fully broken.</p>

<p>It is NOT a good thing to raise a child who is not a fighter. It
is NOT a good thing to raise a child who “agrees” constantly, and
conforms to what his teachers say constantly. It is NOT a good
thing to raise a child who doesn't care about high mathematics and
reason and high philosophy.</p>

<p>One should raise an idealist, but that would certainly make
supporting themselves and raising a family more difficult if they
are genuinely candid.</p>

<p>It is certainly a shame &ndash; the degree of mania in the society
right now.</p>

<p>It makes the world almost unlivable if one wants to retain ones
integrity.</p>

<p>It is possible but it will be a struggle.</p>

<p>I think Stallman is a great example for many people of someone
who retains their integrity through anything. I have as well.</p><div class='article_link'><a href="5.html">Previous article</a>
