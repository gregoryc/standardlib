<h1>AI Is Good, And <span style="color:red;">Bad</span></h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>

<p>Here's an example of how the current mainstream engineering
establishment is so dangerous.</p>
<br>

<p>Can one “advocate for speed” and be tolerated in ones speech?
What about to robots?</p>

<p>Memmem is probably faster than strstr, right?</p>
<p class="robot">ChatGPT</p>

<p>In general, memmem is often more efficient than strstr for
certain use cases because it is designed for searching arbitrary
memory regions, whereas strstr is specifically tailored for
null-terminated strings.</p>

<p>memmem takes two memory regions and their lengths as parameters,
allowing it to work with binary data or non-null-terminated
strings. This flexibility makes it suitable for scenarios where you
want to find occurrences of one block of memory within another.</p>

<p>On the other hand, strstr assumes null-terminated strings, so it
looks for the occurrence of a substring within another string until
it encounters a null character. If you are working with
null-terminated strings and want to find one string within another,
strstr is appropriate.</p>

<p>In summary, if you are dealing with binary data or
non-null-terminated strings, memmem is likely to be more efficient.
If you are working with null-terminated strings, strstr is the
appropriate choice. Always consider the specific requirements and
characteristics of your data when choosing between these
functions.</p>

<p>strstr is not the appropriate choice if you already know
sizes.</p>
<p class="robot">ChatGPT</p>

<p>You're correct, and I appreciate the clarification. If you
already know the sizes of the memory regions you're working with,
and you're dealing with non-null-terminated data or binary data,
then memmem is indeed a more appropriate choice.</p>

<p>memmem allows you to specify the lengths of the memory regions
directly, making it more versatile for searching within arbitrary
binary data, where null characters may not be meaningful. In such
cases, memmem is likely to be more efficient and accurate compared
to strstr, which assumes null-terminated strings.</p>

<p>So, when dealing with known sizes and non-null-terminated data,
memmem is a better fit for the task. Thank you for pointing that
out.</p>

<p>I hate how programmers use slow functions all the time. Our
modern world is so slow.</p>
<p class="robot">ChatGPT</p>

<p>The choice of functions in programming often involves trade-offs
between various factors, such as ease of use, readability,
maintainability, and performance. It's essential to strike a
balance based on the specific requirements of the task at hand and
the characteristics of the data being processed.</p>

<p>Sometimes, programmers prioritize clarity and readability over
raw performance, especially when the impact on overall system speed
is negligible or when code maintainability is a higher concern. In
other cases, performance-critical sections of code may be optimized
for speed using more efficient algorithms or functions.</p>

<p>It's important to note that what may seem “slow” in one context
might be perfectly acceptable in another. In many applications, the
perceived slowness of certain operations might not significantly
impact the overall performance of the system, and the benefits of
clear, maintainable code may outweigh the potential gains from
micro-optimizations.</p>

<p>If you find specific performance bottlenecks in your code, it's
a good practice to profile and analyze the performance to identify
the areas that truly need optimization. Optimizing prematurely
without profiling can lead to complex and harder-to-maintain code,
and the gains might not be as substantial as expected.</p>

<p>Overall, programming is a balance of various considerations, and
the choice of functions depends on the specific requirements of the
task and the goals of the software project.</p>

<p>Acceptable to whom? These engineers are incompetent.</p>
