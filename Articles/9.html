<h1>Perfect Hardware and Software</h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>

<p>For some reason, since the advent of the computing revolution,
no one has been aiming for perfect hardware or software.</p>

<p>Now, in the realm of hardware, this is somewhat understandable,
there are physical limitations (at least in theory &ndash; maybe there
are not) that impede things from happening. People work to overcome
these.</p>

<p>But in the context of the limits of such, there is software.</p>

<p>The amount of layers of abstraction that people have created in
software, that just end up making a given operation take 100 times
longer, and therefore being less flexible if someone wants to do it
a different way, is astounding.</p>

<p>Take, for example, filesystem access and modification speed of C
vs. Node.js or Ruby or Python (or C++ with slow libraries).</p>

<p>The difference is tremendous. All without any physical
differences, just because C is closer to the machine.</p>

<p>These unabashed abstraction layers are divorced from idealism
and logic (see the 1st and 6th article) and slow everything and
everyone down. There is no upside, other than increasing work hours
(which is a terrible reason, and should not be supported).</p>

<p>There is no reason why the same functions that, say, Ruby has to
read a file, cannot exist in a ubiquitous and ideal form in C -
ideal in every context, and every platform, with different
implementations and perhaps different function names depending on
the platform.</p>

<p>Does anything like this exist? It does now (to be humble, at
least in a working version) &ndash; with FOUNDATIONALLIB -
FOUNDATIONALLIB for C (github.com/gregoryc/foundationallib)</p>

<p>There is also no reason why using a computer should be HARD or
SLOW or ERROR-PRONE.</p>

<p>And there is no reason why code can't be dynamic enough to
customize the output depending on the platform and circumstances -
ensuring these things</p>

<p>IDEAL SPEED &ndash; INCLUDING NO EXCESSIVE OPERATIONS</p>

<p>IDEAL OPERATION &ndash; ALL ERRORS CHECKED UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT
SUCH</p>

<p>PROPER CUSTOMIZATION</p>

<p>MINIMAL MEMORY USAGE &ndash; WHEN IT MATTERS</p>

<p>This is the ideal. All should seek for it &ndash; and should fight to
have others seek for it &ndash; perhaps literally fight if needed or
wanted.</p>

<p>We live in a highly computerized world, there's no reason not to
make every aspect of it perfect.</p><div class='article_link'><a href="8.html">Previous article</a>
