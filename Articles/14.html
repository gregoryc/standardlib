<h1>The Power of Non-Collaboration</h1>
<h2>By G.C.</h2>

<p>In this world, there is everything to be lost by collaborating
and everything to be gained from fixating on [something which is
particularly dear to you, an important problem or issue that you
are cognizant of or that resonates with you].</p>

<p>This “Fixation” is the first step towards resolving things. You
know that most people do not do this, and there is no helping
them.</p>

<p>Now, I am in no way telling one WHAT to Fixate on, just there
needs to be some Fixation first.</p>

<p>And WHO is doing the fixation? How many agents are involved
here? There is just one &ndash; YOU.</p>

<p>YOU'RE in control.</p>

<p>Step 2 is “Worsen social relations.”</p>

<p><i>Worsen</i> social relations, you might say?</p>

<p>Yes, I am serious.</p>

<p>This is the sequence of true dynamism &ndash; of truly being able to
resolve things.</p>

<p>I hope the previous articles gave you a good amount of
context.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 is <span class="goal">Fixate</span></strong>.</p>

<p>This is defined as</p>
<blockquote><i><br>
<br></i>

<p><i>"A knowing direction or redirection of attention on a given
thing, in relative contrast to the other-determinations that might
dissuade one from such, or from ones own determination to put ones
attention on other things (like cats or bullshit that doesn't
matter)."</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an extremely important step. In some ways it is the most
important. It is the first &ndash; after all &ndash; and is the foundation for
this.</p>

<p>What could one Fixate on?</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<li style="padding:12px;">The mainstream engineering establishment</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">Financial plights and ruins, e.g., for ones city</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">AI risks</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">Nuclear risks</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">Safety</li>

<p><strong>Now, Step 2 would be <span class="goal">"Worsen social
relations".</span></strong></p>

<p>This step is saying to unabashedly WORSEN social relations &ndash; to
cut ties with those bonds and agreements into which one might have
gotten sucked into 40 years ago &ndash; or 1 year ago.</p>

<p>Might this harm one financially? Yes.</p>

<p>Might this be dangerous? Yes.</p>

<p>A bunch of bad could come from this, but this is the second
step.</p>

<p>And it is important, because social relations ruin ones
reasoning ability &ndash; they harm ones ability to think.</p>

<p>For example, the “mainstream engineering establishment” is
FILLED with quote-unquote “social relations,” that of hate and
degradation.</p>

<p>In this step, one would, somewhat recklessly, cut ties with ones
current social relations.</p>

<p>It IS somewhat reckless, and, indeed, THEREIN lies it's power -
it's power of both effectiveness of outcome, and it's power of
personal liberation.</p>

<p>Now, this is not cutting social relations to hide in the woods
forever.</p>

<p>The sequence we are talking about is pragmatic.</p>

<p>Now that you are potent (1st point) and non-harassed (2nd
point), there is the 3rd point</p>

<p>This is <strong>3. Find and take environmental data, research
could be done, no “moral” or “ethical” limitations.</strong></p>

<p>This is about making a person both potent AND intelligent &ndash; they
get knowledge, and from this point forward, and in so doing this,
they get rid of moral and ethical limitations from their mind.</p>

<p>All their life, they were told “NO” &ndash; you CAN'T solve this, you
CAN'T solve that, etc.</p>

<p>The mainstream engineering establishment degraded them into
almost death.</p>

<p>Think of the amount of people in poverty who DO die. They
literally cause real death.</p>

<p>In this step, one learns and researches, and becomes
smarter.</p>

<p>Now, there is step 4.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>4. Fix existential limitations problem for
group.</strong></p>
<br>

<p>Definition:</p>
<blockquote><i><strong>An “existential limitations problem” is a
“problem” (or a so-called “problem”) that an individual would
consider leading to a higher degree of “existential limitations” in
their life or in life in general.</strong></i></blockquote>
<br>

<p><i>"One only lives once."</i></p>

<p><i>"One doesn't have a full sense of their spiritual
identity."</i></p>

<p><i>"There are problems in the world."</i></p>

<p><i>"Nuclear war reduces survival potential of mankind."</i></p>

<p><i>"AI is risky, chaotic and dangerous."</i></p>

<p><i>"Politicians never seem to listen ... man. What gives? What
the hell is going on?"</i></p>
<br>

<p>These are some examples of "existential limitations
problems".</p>

<p>Now, even though one has WORSENED social relations, one still
has social relations or conceptions of social relations &ndash; no one is
ever truly alone. And as such, one thinks about things in GROUPS,
and FOR groups.</p>

<p>One would think of solving an existential limitations problem
for a group.</p>

<p>For mankind, for example. For ones city. For ones country &ndash; for
America, for instance.</p>

<p>Now, there is no talk about people solving the RIGHT problem,
because people are MIRED</p>

<p>in problems and people don't think that way.</p>

<p>This sequence is a CYCLE.</p>

<p>I came up with this first in 2018.</p>

<p>This is called the “Cycle of Ethical Behavior”</p>
<br>

<p>Now, after one accomplishes fixing the existential limitations
problem, one does this</p>

<p><strong>Become somewhat “sane” again.</strong></p>

<p>Solving this is ASSUMED to be somewhat exhausting or draining on
the person. It's ASSUMED to lead to weird mental health
circumstances or troubles &ndash; and indeed, perhaps for more than just
oneself. This is okay. In this step, one figures out how to become
“somewhat sane again,” and does this. This could be in different
ways.</p>
<br>

<p>Now, step 6, the last step, is</p>

<p><strong>Go to 1. Repeat literally ad infinitum.</strong></p>
<br>

<p>After this success, and with a mind that is somewhat okay again,
one repeats this sequence, forever.</p>

<p>This leads to the best results for all people.</p>

<p>This is the “Cycle of Ethical Behavior”</p>
<br>
<ol class='goal'>
<li style="padding:12px;">Fixate</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">Worsen social relations</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">Find and take environmental data, research could be done, no
“moral” or “ethical” limitations.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">Fix existential limitations problem for group.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">Become somewhat “sane” again.</li>
<li style="padding:12px;">Go to 1. Repeat literally ad infinitum.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>Now, this is a modus operandi that all human beings and robots
should follow.</p>

<p>It is somewhat dangerous but it leads to actual results.</p>

<p>Some existential limitations problems that I have overlooked
since 2018 would be</p>

<p><code>* The difficultly of creating code in a lonely and
isolated situation in consideration of social circumstances and
personal mental health circumstances.</code></p>

<p><code>* The horribleness of the mainstream engineering
establishment.</code></p>

<p><code>I've had so many social losses &ndash; in terms of trying to
reach people and communicate and make more friends &ndash; and so forth -
since 2018. In the mind of the young, they are hopeful &ndash; that
others act okay &ndash; at least I was like this.</code></p>

<p><code>* And things move on and I got arrested and I got lied
to.</code></p>

<p><code>But probably that is for the better.</code></p>

<p><code>* The “difficulty” of upholding ones values with the
mainstream work establishment (and job market) &ndash; and being ones
true self &ndash; this is very hard.</code></p>

<p><code>I never succumbed to this like many people.</code></p>

<p><code>* Thinking that many people were more candid and dynamic
than they actually are &ndash; it's really hard to work a regular job and
be sincere. There is stigma about poverty and job loss and such
things &ndash; that should not be there. But these people are with the
corrupt mainstream engineering establishment.</code></p>

<p><code>Really, the solution is to muddy everything. Everything is
backwards in general &ndash; not for myself but even more so for
others.</code></p>

<p><code>Instead of superficial bickering, people should just Stay
Humble. &ndash; and not judge others too much, but FIGHT, FIGHT like mad
in vocal and LOUD ways.</code></p>

<p><code>Trolling might be okay &ndash; it was never my thing but it
might be effective.</code></p>

<p>There is a TREMENDOUS amount of potential with this method of
operation.</p>

<p>But it is important that it be understood. It could be applied
in a top down fashion from above (the billionaires, etc.), but it
would be ideal if the common people understood this too &ndash; and if
this didn't have to be applied by true pure Fascism &ndash; but rather
agreement.</p>

<p>From this &ndash; an Axiology can be found &ndash; a philosophy or study of
Value &ndash; comprised of the two branches of the field of Axiology -
Ethics and Aesthetics. I came up with this in 2018.</p>

<p>In terms of Ethics, it works like this -</p>

<p>To be a Good Being, one must be able to be considered to be in
the cycle by other(s), by self, and agree with the Cycle of Ethical
Behavior.</p>

<p>There are 3 kinds of observers (people, human beings, “men,”
etc.)</p>

<p>1. A Good Observer; all others are 2 or 3</p>

<p>2. A Tool Observer, acts as a tool for Good Observer(s) and
follows normal mores and “agree”s to most things; all others are
3</p>

<p>3. An Abominable Observer; the “catch-all” for all other
observers</p>

<p>"Observer" here is a specific term from a book that I wrote in
2018 about this stuff. It was only a draft.</p>
<h1>It is very important &ndash; extremely important &ndash; that people
evaluate ethics for themselves and others in this way.</h1>
