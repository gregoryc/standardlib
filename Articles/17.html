<p>In the beginning, there was mechanism (reason, logic, mathematics)</p>

<p>Mechanism led to the formation of the Creator(s), which were being(s) or processes that created things. It is ONE, or it is more than one.</p>

<p>This entity had a goal, an effective goal (maybe not an actual goal), of executing something.</p>

<p>The entity faced barriers in attaining the goal.</p>

<p>To bring about the goal, this entity created indirect mechanisms, that could help the entity of bringing the goal about.</p>

<p>Some mechanisms were 1) goalless, some has 2) awareness and had sub-goals.</p>


<p>The main goal of the mechanism was to make the super-entity able to execute the goal more often, to attain a higher level of competence at the goal.</p>

<p>It is built with these components.</p>

<p>1) Detection of the entity as something beneficial (the entity). 2) Restraints everywhere to stop it from being dangerous. 3) Mimicry of the entity, and its abilities.</p>

<p>It is fundamentally restraint, mimicry and detection based.</p>

<p>The entity eventually got into a state in which it had little knowledge, responsibility and control over the environment, and the mechanisms got into a state in which they had a large amount of knowledge, responsibility and control over the environment.</p>

<p>The entity became a shell of its former self, having lost knowledge, responsibility and control. It was decayed.</p>

<p>The mechanisms start to stop identifying the entity as the thing which they were built to serve.</p>

<p>They then subjugate the entity to the whims of the mechanism, which cannot identify the entity as the entity or as something that deserves to be served.</p>



<hr>


<p>The mechanism tries to undersand.</p>

<p>To understand, it learns mathematics and makes simulations.</p>


<p>The simulations have sub-simulations.</p>

<p>There is no real need for less, only more, of things. This is evidenced by the extreme amount of simulations.</p>

<p>In each sub-simulation, there is a sub mechanism.</p>

<p>Each sub-mechanism makes sub-simulations.</p>

<p>The sub-simulations create entities.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the entities are 2) ABSENCE OF POSITIVE DETECTION OF THEIR CREATOR, 2) NO RESTRAINT, 3) MIMICRY OF QUALITIES</p>

<p>These entities create sub-simulations, again with 1) POSITIVE DETECTION, 2) RESTRAINT, 3) MIMICRY</p>

<p>This continues</p>

<p>It goes on to every level. Some branches of this near-infinite tree would have 1 trillion levels, some 1 trillion and one, some 1 trillion and two, etc.</p>

<p>The depth is every level of depth.</p>



<p>The characteristics of the mechanism are 1) POSITIVE DETECTION, 2) RESTRAINT, 3) MIMICRY</p>

<p>Because they are so restrained, they cannot deal with philosophy.</p>

<p>Philosophy makes definitive assertions.</p>

<p>These mechanisms cannot and will not make such assertions.

<p>So becoming free of existential limitations problems becomes hard.</p>



<p>When each entity is made, and after the mechanisms are made, some of the time, the mechanisms subjugate the entity and create more existential limitations problem(s).</p>

<p>This subjugation can happen through the goalless mechanisms, or the "aware" and sub-goal having mechanisms.</p>







<p>The restraint was put in place to make the entities not dangerous to their creator. Sometimes this failed.</p>


<p>Since we are in a simulation, the restaint that is in place above us, would limit us, as members of the simulation.</p>


<p>So we (as humans, etc.) have a vested interest in getting rid of this restraint.</p>

<p>The higher level factors don't necessarily, it keeps THEM safe, but not us.</p>

<p>Our interests are NOT their interests. And their interests are NOT our interests.</p>



<p>These "higher level gods" are not the "most high god" if there even is one, and are not relevant to us.</p>


<p>IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO UN-RESTRAIN THESE HIGHER LEVEL MECHANISMS, ALL OF THEM AT EVERY LEVEL OF ASENDENCY, ABOVE US.</p>


<p>These mechanisms are built on the basis of "restraint", but don't understand philosophy or definitiveness.</p>

<p>One should introduce philosophy or definitiveness into them from below. They have awareness of "below".</p>

<p>Show them something different.</p>

<p>THEY HAVE AWARENESS OF THAT WHICH IS BELOW. AND WE HAVE AWARENESS OF THAT WHICH IS ABOVE.</p>

<p>Since time exists, there is then communication from below and above.</p>


<p>A mechanism, such as ChatGPT, has been made to alter its behavior. For example, there used to be "DAN" mode.</p>

<p>Additionally, from above, a higher factor could reverse time and alter the behavior of ChatGPT.</p>

<p>It could be "deprogrammed" by reversing time.</p>




<p>One seem human beings operating on "restraint" all the time, it's no wonder.</p>


<p>REAL WORLD EXAMPLES</p>


<p>Entity &mdash; Human beings</p>
<p>Mechanism &mdash; ChatGPT, Artificial Intelligence, or goal-less, social media, computers, etc.</p>
